Abstract
In today's competitive collaborative workspace, real-time document editing and sharing is greatly required for work to be as efficient as possible. 
Our project is a simulator of Google Docs-the core functionality of Google Docs will be replicated in such a way that a user will be able to create, edit, and collaborate with other users on documents in real time. Our system is built with React.js for the frontend, Quill is used to handle the rich text editing interface, allowing users to input and format text in real-time, and Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication, with MongoDB used for data persistence. That will ensure seamless document editing across multiple users. The project showcases real-time synchronization where multiple users may view and edit the same document with updates visible in real time to every party involved. Low latency messaging is enabled through WebSockets, and MongoDB is there to persist as well as retrieve the document data. Thus, these services help the users save, load and continue their work across sessions. In our Google Docs Simulator, we have really focused on using modern web technologies for collaborative writing and editing across a distributed system.
